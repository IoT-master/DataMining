    "DID SHE JUST SAY GENITAL SNEEZE?": "Every time I hear someone refer to an orgasm as a \u2018genital sneeze\u2019 it makes me cringe. It is reminiscent of Freud stating that clitoral orgasms were \u2018juvenile\u2019 and that mature women should have \u2018vaginal\u2019 orgasms instead. (That one never made sense anyway\u2026 http:\/\/www.apsexed.com\/blog\/in-search-of-the-vaginal-orgasm ) It implies that one is less than the other, not good or not desirable.\nThe community that the sneeze comment is originating from is the same one that is typically sex positive and advocates against this kind of sexual shaming. I fully understand the intended message that there is more to be had than a quick vibrator induced orgasm.\nI believe it would be far more helpful to talk about the options and experiences that exist beyond the obvious, instead of shutting down the conversation through criticism. And also to accept without judgement that a portion of the population might be perfectly happy with the orgasms they are having and uninterested in a life or practice dedicated to finding something else. Shame paralyzes, Education empowers. That is all for today kids! ",
    "ONCE UPON A VAGINA...": "This morning, as my friend was placing a piece of garlic in her vagina (a good idea from time to time), I briefly wondered if it might be uncomfortable as she went about her day. Then I realized how silly this thought was. Many of us skip around all day with a tampon, sea sponge or various other items situated comfortably up in the vaginal canal. The lack of distraction is due to the low sensitivity of the vaginal canal, which is sometimes compared to the digestive tract or the scrotum (aka ball sack, aka testicle doily, there\u2019s really no attractive word for this one yet\u2026)\n\nPlacing something in the vaginal entrance, the sphincter that closes and protects the vaginal canal, could be quite uncomfortable. However, having a small object near the top of the canal (the end near the cervix and uterus) would hypothetically be no more uncomfortable than food in the intestine, a sensation we are typically blissfully unaware of. Of course, there are exceptions depending on each woman\u2019s unique landscape. If something is sharp, protruding or irritating, that is a different story. It could also be possible to experience a feeling of pressure against the surrounding tissue and organs, the same way one might feel overly full after a large meal, depending on the size and shape of the object.\n\nThe low sensitivity of the vaginal canal explains why women are not walking around experiencing arousal and \u2018vaginal\u2019 orgasms all day with an object inside the vaginal canal (a common question among boys). This example also supports the idea that female orgasms occurring during penetration are actually a result of stimulating nearby erectile tissue, not the elusive (and non-existent) \u2018vaginal orgasm\u2019.\n\nJust in case you were wondering. \n\n(pretty vulva pendant:\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/497427192\/yoni-vulva-vagina-pendant-feminine?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=vagina pendant&ref=sr_gallery_5 )",
    "THE ORGANIZATION OF HUMANS": "Let\u2019s say, hypothetically, there are two groups of humans. The humans in one group are stronger in communication, have an increased ability to read expressions, tone and body language, a strong biological desire for the wellbeing of everyone. They are physically smaller and highly motivated by connection. The second group is physically larger, more aggressive, competitive and less risk averse, especially when young.\n\nThe highly vigilant humans in the first group are always subconsciously scanning for potential dangers to themselves, children and the community as a whole. A look or a tone will alert them that someone or something is not what it seems. Some might call it intuition, but it is in fact an evolutionary trait developed for survival of the species. Caring for others is chemically rooted in these humans, not a conscious choice. They are the caretakers, the guardians, the glue that holds families and communities together.\n\nThe humans in the second group were born to move and make things move. The less sensitive nervous systems make them fearless in the face of danger and capable of quickly searching for immediate actions without being distracted by emotion. They are strong and feel invincible under certain circumstances. These are also evolutionary traits that contribute to survival of the species. They are the protectors, the fighters, the selfless warriors.\n\nThanks to neuroplasticity, these traits, skills and tendencies can be strengthened or weakened over time. As humans are most comfortable operating in the areas where they feel strong, at ease and valuable, there is a natural tendency to further develop these inherent skills.\n\nFast forward a few decades. Leadership has been placed in the hands of the larger, more aggressive humans. The humans who are strong in action and attack, willing and capable of battling physical danger, because they are wired for it. But this group is lacking in both verbal and nonverbal communication. They are unable to read the expressions and intentions of other groups. Both less motivated and less capable of negotiating solutions that work for everyone, they are undeterred by violence and some even enjoy it. And so we fight. And we keep fighting. There are attempts at peace and resolution, but the members of Group 2 don\u2019t have the skills or the strong desire to succeed in this area.\n\nUnfortunately, the skills of Group 1 are criticized and viewed as weakness in a society organized in this fashion.  When a member of Group 1 attempts to take a place of leadership, they will be hard pressed to find support when both groups have been conditioned to believe that any display of emotion or compassion makes them unfit to govern or guide. They are condemned for a single display of tears or anything other than the ruthlessness that Group 2 believes is essential.\n\nBut this is a costly misconception. Both groups would benefit from choosing leadership that displays emotion, compassion and sensitivity, because those are traits of humans who will do whatever it takes to care for everyone involved. The humans who are biologically and chemically driven to put the wellbeing of those around them above their own, because they have no choice in the feelings. They are unable to rest while others suffer, because they feel it too strongly, it hurts them too much. These are the strongest, most committed and compassionate leaders and governors.\n\nThis group\u2019s natural response to a threat is to band together and work it out, avoiding any conflict that might put relationships at risk. They are highly motivated to resolve the problem peacefully and avoid the violence they have an aversion to. This puts the minds of Group 1 at ease, but also keeps Group 2 alive.\n\nBoth groups are essential to the survival of the species and play an important role in the community when utilizing their natural strengths. Both groups also pay a high price when one group takes on both roles, without having both skill sets, while the other is undervalued and unutilized.  ",
    "FEMALE ERECTION?": "The female body contains even more erectile tissue than the male body. Erectile tissue is located in the penis for men and the clitoris, vestibular bulbs, urethral sponge, g-zone for women.\n\nJust as the penis needs to be fully engorged (puffy, swollen) before penetration, so does female erectile tissue. Without arousal, some forms of touch or penetration can feel unpleasant or painful, a clear message from the body to wait. However, with engorgement some of those same activities may feel completely different. It\u2019s all about timing and arousal.\n\nFor example, when swollen, the vestibular bulbs cushion either side of the vaginal entrance, essentially acting like air bags and protecting the body during penetration. There are a number of other physical changes in a woman\u2019s pelvis during arousal that protect delicate tissues and make sex more pleasurable.\n\n\nMost of us know how to tell when a penis is engorged and ready for penetration. Similarly, we can see and feel the difference in women\u2019s bodies. The photo below is one example of the noticeable change.\n\n\nEngorgement, not vaginal lubrication, is the indicator that a woman\u2019s body may be aroused and ready for penetration. The vagina will lubricate for a number of reasons, including protection from friction, so do not use this as the sole indicator. And do not skip arousal.",
    "DISCOVERING THE P-SPOT": "Warning, this will be much funnier if you are familiar with **Dr Grafenberg's claimed discovery of the G-Spot (the Urethral sponge, aka G-spot, aka female prostate, has always been there and was previously documented over the years) and invention of the IUD. If this guy can 'discover' and name the sponge after himself, I will lay claim to the previously documented penis using my last initial as well\u2026\n\nExciting Announcement!\n\nI have discovered a dime sized spot of overly sensitive tissue in a man\u2019s genital region, at the tip of the extraneous, cylindrical tissue that hangs from his pelvis, above the testes. If rubbed vigorously for a number of minutes, it appears to provide sexual pleasure for some men. This evidence supports my theory that males may also be capable of some level of sexual desire, previously though to belong only to females. I am calling this mysterious area the P-Spot in light of my discovery.\n\nSome men are claiming the ability to \u2018ejaculate\u2019 with stimulation, but this is highly doubtful. More than likely, when tested, we will find that the fluid is simply urine coming from the urethra.\n\nI have also developed a device I am calling the UID, or Urethral Interruption Device, for conception prevention in men. The device will be inserted, by a physician, through the urethra and will work in one of two ways. The hormonal version will disrupt the male hormones, rendering the man infertile while the device is in place, for years at a time. The copper version achieves the same result by creating a \u2018minor irritation\u2019 inside the body and is expected to be equally effective to sterilization. Two strings will extend through the urethra and can be trimmed so as not to be \u2018bothersome\u2019. Checking the strings will allow the man to determine that the device stays in place and allow for future removal of the device.\n\nAs we know that women are only fertile for approximately 24 hours every month, but men are fertile 24 hours a day, every day, it only makes sense to put the contraceptive device in the constantly fertile sex.\n\nThere may be some side effects, but we believe they will not be a deterrent to most men:\n\u00b7         Pain upon insertion (pain relieving medications are available)\n\u00b7         Perforation of the urethra during insertion (not common)\n\u00b7         Heavy bleeding lasting weeks or months (usually ending within 3-5 months)\n\u00b7         Cramping, Headache, Nausea, Acne\n\u00b7         Breast tenderness, Backache, Abdominal and Pelvic pain\n\u00b7         Painful Sex\n\u00b7         Mood changes\n\u00b7         Weight gain\n\u00b7         Internal Cysts\n\u00b7         Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (thought to be caused by filaments in the \u2018strings\u2019)\n\u00b7         May not be used in anyone with active infection of STD\n\u00b7         High cost that may not be covered by insurance\n\u00b7         The device does not protect against STD\u2019s, so condoms use should be continued\n\n*The satirical writing above is based on actual descriptions of the \u2018G Spot discovery\u2019 and actual IUD (intrauterine device) side effects. Sounds crazy when we are referring to men, doesn\u2019t it?\n \n**The G spot was supposedly first identified in 1950 by the German gynecologist Ernst Grafenberg and was long thought to belong to the female urological anatomy. But its powers of pleasure have been attested to as far back as the third century, when an early medical text reported the swelling of the anterior vaginal wall during sexual arousal.\n ",
    "IN SEARCH OF THE VAGINAL ORGASM": "I\u2019m hearing about the pursuit of the elusive \u2018vaginal orgasm\u2019 a lot these days. But, what exactly is the vaginal orgasm and why are we seeking it?\n\nA quick poll revealed that seekers are generally referencing any orgasm resulting from an object penetrating the vagina.   \n\nMaybe it goes back to the days of Freud:\n\n\u2018In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasm was purely an adolescent phenomenon, and upon reaching puberty the proper response of mature women was a changeover to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. While Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, the consequences of this theory were considerable. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone or involving little or no clitoral stimulation. \n\nMany psychiatrists trained in psychoanalytic theory, or influenced by some of their teachers who were primarily Freudian analysts, were influenced by these writings. Therefore, they would focus on a patient\u2019s report of orgasm mainly by clitoral stimulation as being indicative of early conflicts and failure to mature properly. This might lead to deeper psychoanalytic treatment. In other situations, the nature of current relationships might be questioned. Still another approach was to consider this a sexual inhibition which might respond to a cognitive therapy where corrective suggestions were offered to women to achieve orgasm with \u201cproper masturbation.\u201d\u2019\n\nIn essence, this would mean that a mature (meaning what\u2026 marriageable? fuckable?) female abandons her own pleasure and switches to a method that often provides the most stimulation, pleasure and orgasm for males\u2026\n\nSorry Freud, I\u2019m not doing it wrong. You\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nCriticizing or diagnosing women for not orgasming from a technique that provides stimulation to male erectile tissue, resulting in male orgasm is highly irrational. It would be akin to criticizing a man for not achieving orgasm from scrotum stimulation. Some women are no more likely to come from stroking a penis with their vagina than from stroking a penis with their hand, this is perfectly normal.\n\nMore importantly, where are all the orgasms coming from?\n\nStimulating the opening of the vaginal canal, the introitus, can arouse surrounding erectile tissue and internal portions of the clitoris. The clitoris is so much more than the small, visible clitoral head (glans), it actually includes a larger internal wishbone shaped structure\n\nAn inch or two inside the vagina is the G Zone, aka G-Spot, an area along the roof of the vagina whereby the urethral sponge can be stimulated. The sponge is outside and above the vagina and swells around the urethra during arousal.\n\nSome women have reported pleasurable sensations from stimulation of the cervix (between the vagina and uterus). I will need more information to comment on this one.\n \nSo, what about the vagina? (It should be noted that a search for definitions of the vagina, turned up many anatomically inaccurate results. We still have a long way to go in educating medical professionals on female anatomy.)\n\n\u2018Vagina: The muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the outside of the body. The vagina is located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the urinary bladder and anterior to the rectum.\u2019\n\n\u2018The interior of the vagina: Like nearly all other internal body structures, poorly supplied with end organs of touch. The internal entodermal origin of the lining of the vagina makes it similar in this respect to the rectum (anal canal) and other parts of the digestive tract. (Kinsey, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, p.580.)\n\nSensitivity of the vaginal canal is thought to be quite low, comparable to the scrotum, digestive tract and anal canal. (There is erectile tissue near the anal canal which accounts for pleasure experienced during anal penetration.)\n\nGiven this information, it seems unlikely that any truly vaginal stimulation is eliciting an orgasm. More likely, orgasms that are thought to arise solely from vaginal penetration may be the result of stimulating one or more parts of the Erectile Network (Clitoris, Urethral sponge \/ G Zone, Perineal Sponge, Vestibular bulbs). An unsurprising misconception, since most men and women don't have access to accurate female anatomy.\n\nIn addition, there are 4 main nerves extending into the female pelvis, facilitating pleasure and orgasm (which is a largely mental process). Each person is uniquely innervated, so naturally sensitivity varies from person to person.\n\nThe nerve sensitivity we are born with can be further shaped by many factors throughout our lives. The brains ability to build new neuropathways and abandon those that go unused is known as neuroplasticity. This means that stimulating one area consistently can strengthen the neuropathways in that area over time. However, it also means that neuropathways to overlooked areas can weaken from lack of use. The good news is that we can \u2018teach\u2019 new areas of our body to join arousal through practice and stimulation.\nI believe that focusing on individual sensation can be more helpful to experiencing and increasing pleasure, than searching for a specific kind of orgasm which may not technically exist. Not to mention, it sounds like far more fun\u2026\n\n* The above ideas are based on currently available information. Scientific facts change regularly and the study of female anatomy is clearly in its infancy. All theories are therefore subject to revision as new information becomes available!",

    "THE G-SPOT STILL DOESN'T EXIST?": "I know I've said this before, but I'm so confused that anyone is still denying the existence of the 'G Spot'? Doctors are still publishing papers calling it a myth? (Should we feel bad for their wives?!)\n\nThe naming of the G Spot isn't accurate in my opinion, but how can we debate the existence of anatomy that we can see and feel? It\u2019s like saying women don\u2019t have tongues. After you stick a finger in her mouth...\n \nBut the male prostate is not in question, even though it is more challenging to reach and stimulate? And has similar function (swells around the urethra during arousal) and develops from the same fetal tissue that becomes the female urethral sponge (g-zone)\u2026 Oh right, the prostates not in the ~*~mythical land of vagina~*~.\n\nNot to mention the orgasmic g-zone experiences many women have had. (They sell tools to easily reach the spot for goodness' sake. Lots of them.) I presume that the persons questioning the anatomy's existence have little to no experience with female orgasm... \n \nDoes anyone remember that women were previously 'diagnosed' with 'hysteria' caused by a 'roaming uterus'? (Seriously, doctors claimed that women's medical conditions were caused by a uterus 'wandering around inside the body'. A bad uterus looking for sperm.) Reportedly, these were not female doctors. Likely the same medical authorities that currently assure us the 'G-Spot' doesn't exist... At least you know you\u2019re in good hands!\n \n\u2018\u2026 With the wandering womb, Hippocrates connected epilepsy to hysteria describing a seizure as the result of the uterus nearing the liver (Ng, 1999).  Epilepsy continued to be one of the symptoms often attributed to hysteria as the illness developed.\u2019\n ",
    "THE MALE G-ZONE & CULTURAL DOUBLE STANDARDS": "Lately, we've been discussing double standards that negatively affect women in our society. As a female with a female experience, I naturally have less experience with the male equivalent, but I'm always curious. Thoughts and Experiences?\ni.e. It is both acceptable and encouraged for most women to seek and experience G-zone (Urethral Sponge) pleasure\/orgasm (sometimes referred to as 'vaginal orgasm', whether that term is accurate is a separate topic.)\nHowever many men do not feel a similar level of acceptance experimenting with stimulating the male Sponge\/G-zone (aka prostate) even though it is a homologous structure (developed from the same tissue that became the female urethral sponge) and may provide pleasurable sensation.\nThis may be due in part to the stigma attached to male anal penetration... I think it's important to examine the ways in which social structure affects the well being of all involved, to avoid creating 'sides' that work against each other instead of collaborating for a solution that benefits everyone. Men do not fare well in the current system either... No one does.",
    "THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT": "You know how I like to talk about the benefits of each cycle phase and how to enjoy our skills throughout the month and how much I love even the darker, less energetic phases of the cycle? The way premenstrual week allows us increased access to awareness, critical thinking, organization, sensitivity and the ability to bring things to completion\u2026\n\nWell, sometimes it sucks too. Sometimes there\u2019s a new moon and I will start bleeding in 4 days and I wake up convinced that no one cares about me and I suck at everything; life, career, sex, all of it. It seems like everything upsets me, I send angry emails to my insurance company (they kind of deserve it, but it\u2019s not the most productive option) and yell at the nice man on the phone trying to help me add beneficiaries to my IRA (even though I did this when I signed up a couple years ago?) And then i give up and cry.\n\nOf course people care about me, wonderful people. But not enough to pick up an Rx for me when I am so sick I can\u2019t imagine how I will get to the car, much less drive it. The people I\u2019ve had sex with send a nice text saying they hope I feel better soon. From the UTI I likely got having sex with them. Sometimes I am honest about how I feel and what I do\/don\u2019t need to do and am told what I should \u2018just do anyway\u2019. I have had enough people tell me what I should do and should feel to last me the rest of my life. Sometimes I'm not in the mood for any of it.\n\nOh, premenstrual week when everything that is not working for us becomes painfully apparent, inviting us to take the opportunity to choose differently in the future. The Darkness and the Light are one and the same, polar opposites of the same spectrum. To be completely transparent, sometimes this is what happens to me.",

    "TOO ASHAMED TO ADMIT WHAT I'VE DONE...": "It would appear that I've developed a personal protocol for preventing shame. (As I picked a peck of pickled peppers...)\n\nEvery time I catch myself thinking 'I cant tell anyone xyz' or 'I don't want anyone to find out I abc', I know that means I need to tell someone. Soon.\n\nSeriously, I'm not that bad, but some days I notice myself thinking that I don't want to tell even my closest girl friends or therapist certain things. It could be actions, thoughts, feelings, decisions, it doesn't matter.\n\n(Brene Brown, Daring Greatly: I define shame as the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging \u2013 something we\u2019ve experienced, done, or failed to do makes us unworthy of connection. \nI don\u2019t believe shame is helpful or productive. In fact, I think shame is much more likely to be the source of destructive, hurtful behavior than the solution or cure. I think the fear of disconnection can make us dangerous.)\n\nAt this point (likely thanks to Brene Brown audiobooks, which I found through the Artemis School), I understand that perceived isolation, the feeling of being the only one who's done this 'bad' thing is the source of varying degrees of shame. Sometimes subtle, sometimes suffocating. I've also witnessed and experienced the freedom and relief of sharing my story, being received with empathy and understanding or stories of shared experience. As a result, feeling accepted and safe, able to make decisions and move forward. Feeling like I still 'belong to tribe', which on an unconscious level feels like life or death, because at some point in our history it was... (Knowing who your resources are is key here! We can do more harm than good with uninformed good intentions sometimes.)\n\nThis is fresh in my mind, because I did something last week that I caught myself deciding I was just going to 'keep to myself', lol. (Awareness is Step 1!)  So, I picked up the phone and told two close friends who know how to respond to these situations. They didn't even think it was a big deal, so I mentally de-escalated the situation from Code Red (I'm-a-terrible-person) to Just-another-day-in-Paradise and went along my merry way :)   \n\nMy (imaginary) friend Brene Brown explains that feelings of shame can quietly marinate over a lifetime. \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line with shame,\u201d she says. \u201cThe less you talk about it, the more you got it.

    "MAGIC WEEK": "The Premenstrual phase. The week or so before my period. I feel like I hear a lot of women say they don\u2019t like this week. Surprisingly, It has become my favorite. I feel like I can float through this period with my feet hardly touching the ground, feeling blissfully barely human, if I am not bound too tightly to my daily routine. A sip of hot tea, a bite of chocolate, a soft blanket, a warm bath; it can be so sweet. If I make space for the experience\u2026\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. The low energy, sensitivity, strong emotions seemed hard to handle a few years ago when I didn\u2019t know how to make the shift. A time to tolerate, just trying to make it through. The irritability, exhaustion, crying. It was only a sign of trying to do too much during a low energy time. (Think about how any human or animal responds when they are exhausted and try to keep working. That is what we are doing to almost every female body every month and then calling it PMS or labeling them \u2018bitchy\u2019. Females are cyclical, as opposed to the more consistent male.) But this phase is only a problem if I don\u2019t plan my schedule in accordance with my cycle. Living out of sync is never fun. But it is a choice.\n\nSo, when this week started to feel really hard, I paused to think about why that might be... Last week was the winter solstice, the new moon was occurring tonight and I would start bleeding in a few days. Talk about a trifecta of deep, dark, flowing feeling. Not something I want to be swimming against! Not to mention that it is a time of beneficial intuition that is only available at this magnitude for a limited time.\n\nSo, I looked at my to-do list and wiped off everything that wasn\u2019t absolutely essential. I turned off my phone. I\u2019m sure anything important will be there when I return. (Maybe I still need to go to work or cook, but I don\u2019t have to run a million errands on the way. I can wear a cozy sweater and sip warm tea while I take my time. I can ignore the texts and talk less. I can accomplish my chosen tasks in a way that doesn\u2019t exhaust me.)\n\nStaying tuned in to the day-to-day keeps me from tuning out and flowing into the soft feminine of the premenstrual phase. It is a time that I curl up like a kitten, wrap myself in safety and security, whatever form that might take this month, and open to the feelings that are flowing strong. I don\u2019t waste any time trying to be \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018productive\u2019. Those are skills for another week. Resistance is an option, but it just doesn\u2019t feel good.\n\nResisting the \u2018negative\u2019 feelings cuts us off from so much useful information. During this phase of increased sensitivity and intuition women can tune in more easily, using the guidance of feelings, the full spectrum of pleasure and pain, to assess and evaluate our course... but not if we are avoiding the pain or the \u2018bad\u2019 feelings. Not if we are uncomfortable with feeling and crying. And not if we are preoccupied and distracted keeping up with the usual high energy routine and completing the never ending to-do list.\n\nRushing may be the easiest way to keep ourselves in the sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system response, as if every moment is an emergency. Everything else (digestion, immune system, rest, intuition) will be de-prioritized until the perceived \u2018emergency\u2019 seems to be over.\n\nSo, I stop rushing to slip into the relaxed state, the parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous system, where the magic happens. I temporarily clear the non-essentials from my to-do list, so I can focus on what is available to me in the moment. So I can take my time, walking slowly, breathing deeply, feeling the sun on my hair, the magic in my body. Like any skill, it takes practice.",
    "I SHOULDN'T BE AT THE OFFICE WHEN I START BLEEDING...": "When I see articles about women prohibited from entering certain places, ceremonies, etc. when they are bleeding I definitely have a reaction, but its not the one I used to have. And it may not be what you would expect. Of course no one should be shunned for being human or female or having a healthy body that bleeds every month. That feels terrible and I would never encourage it. I believe women should choose when and where they go.\n\nBut I also believe that women (and ultimately all people, animals and the world) would benefit from becoming more aware of their bodies and needs and making informed choices about when and where they go...\n\nBeing expected to be at the office, or wherever, at a time when my body physically needs to recline and rest (my personal experience, your mileage may vary) is detrimental to my health, happiness, negatively impacts those around me and ultimately the world.\n\nBleeding time can be a very powerful time, during which women may find that they have unique awareness, skill and power not available through the rest of the month. (Again, a generalization that I have found to be true for myself and many women I know. You are the authority on yourself.)\n\nBut when we don't feel that our lifestyle, job, culture, partner, will allow us the downtime we need to ride the cyclical wave through the month, we have to push, push, push our bodies and spirits beyond their limits. It is a denial of our nature and there is a price to pay. I NEED down time each month. Mood and energy naturally follow estrogen levels, rising around ovulation and declining as we prepare to bleed. So maybe, its not that I am not well suited for the office at this time... but that the office is not well suited for me.\n\nI thank my lucky stars that I work remotely currently and can usually schedule a day off when I need it (my body tells me!) And sometimes I wonder how I used to make it through a day or driving, talking, working, producing on my first day of bleeding. Then I remember that I would eat ibuprofen all day long and it was still painful.\n\nI also cant help but wonder if this pushing past our (natural, reasonable and predictable) limits is what leads to the 'bitchiness' that everyone is complaining about? Think of any human or animal that is exhausted or in pain and trying to push through, under any circumstance. They are snappy and unpleasant. Consistently. Are we not ignoring our bodies and doing the same thing to ourselves each month?\n\nI've experimented  and find that when I am home wrapped in a cozy nest, especially if someone is loving me and I feel safe, relaxed and cared for (I initially thought I would want to spend this time alone, but have found that isn't necessarily true) I don't have any 'bitchiness' problems. I am actually quite soft, relaxed, quiet, sweet, dreamy even... so feminine really. When I am not trying to push my body to do activities that it has neither the energy of desire for at that time, I am just fine.\n\nSo, as crazy as it sounds, from an entirely different perspective (criticism and shunning are never the way, and viewing this as a negative or a weakness are a huge problem), yes, please acknowledge that I don't need to be in the office when I start to bleed. I need to be curled up somewhere comfy. My body makes this inarguably clear during each and every cycle.",
    "GRATITUDE AND POLARITY": "~The masculine feminine attraction is created by the polarity~\nSo what motivates us to ever seek to destroy those differences?\n\nI am feeling grateful to spend time with a man who appreciates and enjoys our differences. It is almost hard to explain... He doesn\u2019t fear my feminine just because it is foreign to him, but actually seeks out and basks in the complementary energy, so different from his own. My feelings, sensitivity and intuition don\u2019t confuse, scare and offend him. Even when at times they become almost unbearably strong for me, as I learn how to best utilize the tools at my fingertips. He doesn\u2019t seek to \u2018help\u2019 me by trying to change me to be like him or criticize me for not feeling like him or doing things his way. He thanks me for being all the things that he is not, so he can enjoy those qualities in his life.\n\nAll the things I've been told for so many years are 'bad' or 'wrong' about me are not. They are just different than my masculine counterparts, which is what draws us together. They are actually some of the best parts of me. Maybe Isee them now because someone else does. Or more likely I am with a person that feels that way because I finally do...\n\nHis desire to feel in his life that which he does not possess in himself is a true inspiration. And an underlying reason the masculine and feminine are so infinitely attracted to each other. I don\u2019t have to defend myself to be in the relationship. He uses his strength to protect all of my sensitivity and softness, so that it may continue to exist and flourish in a safe space and we can both enjoy the fruit. The yin and yang swirling together in acceptance and reverence.\n\nThe other night, I mentioned a sadness at growing up in a culture that doesn\u2019t accept or appreciate some of the most amazing qualities and skills possessed by women. The expansive capacity for emotion, feeling, sensitivity and intuition, to name a few. Such powerful gifts, so often criticized and squashed before they are even realized. (Don\u2019t be such a girl\/pussy\/bitch\/etc.???) (Actually, please do be all of this and more.) Although often unintentional, the criticism of ones nature can be incredibly damaging for everyone involved, including the critic.\n\nHis reply? \u2018I see all of those things in you. It\u2019s why I always want to be around you. I feel better - and better about myself- every moment we spend together, because you are all of those things and I feel them when I\u2019m with you.\u2019 What a difference to be a joy, instead of an inconvenience, to the masculine that I have always craved to be wrapped up in.\n\nI understand that we each possess masculine and feminine, but we are not the same kind of creatures. Hence the attraction and desire for the other.\n\nThe feeling is mutual of course, he is everything that I am not and I bask in the qualities he brings. He just seems to be a natural in the appreciation of the other, while many of us must cultivate the skill..."
