    "DID SHE JUST SAY GENITAL SNEEZE?": "Every time I hear someone refer to an orgasm as a \u2018genital sneeze\u2019 it makes me cringe. It is reminiscent of Freud stating that clitoral orgasms were \u2018juvenile\u2019 and that mature women should have \u2018vaginal\u2019 orgasms instead. (That one never made sense anyway\u2026 http:\/\/www.apsexed.com\/blog\/in-search-of-the-vaginal-orgasm ) It implies that one is less than the other, not good or not desirable. The community that the sneeze comment is originating from is the same one that is typically sex positive and advocates against this kind of sexual shaming. And also to accept without judgement that a portion of the population might be perfectly happy with the orgasms they are having and uninterested in a life or practice dedicated to finding something else.",
    "ONCE UPON A VAGINA...": "Many of us skip around all day with a tampon, sea sponge or various other items situated comfortably up in the vaginal canal. The lack of distraction is due to the low sensitivity of the vaginal canal, which is sometimes compared to the digestive tract or the scrotum (aka ball sack, aka testicle doily, there\u2019s really no attractive word for this one yet\u2026)\n\nPlacing something in the vaginal entrance, the sphincter that closes and protects the vaginal canal, could be quite uncomfortable. However, having a small object near the top of the canal (the end near the cervix and uterus) would hypothetically be no more uncomfortable than food in the intestine, a sensation we are typically blissfully unaware of. The low sensitivity of the vaginal canal explains why women are not walking around experiencing arousal and \u2018vaginal\u2019 orgasms all day with an object inside the vaginal canal (a common question among boys). This example also supports the idea that female orgasms occurring during penetration are actually a result of stimulating nearby erectile tissue, not the elusive (and non-existent) \u2018vaginal orgasm\u2019.",
    "THE ORGANIZATION OF HUMANS": "The humans in one group are stronger in communication, have an increased ability to read expressions, tone and body language, a strong biological desire for the wellbeing of everyone. The highly vigilant humans in the first group are always subconsciously scanning for potential dangers to themselves, children and the community as a whole. When a member of Group 1 attempts to take a place of leadership, they will be hard pressed to find support when both groups have been conditioned to believe that any display of emotion or compassion makes them unfit to govern or guide. Both groups would benefit from choosing leadership that displays emotion, compassion and sensitivity, because those are traits of humans who will do whatever it takes to care for everyone involved. This puts the minds of Group 1 at ease, but also keeps Group 2 alive.",
    "FEMALE ERECTION?": "The female body contains even more erectile tissue than the male body. Just as the penis needs to be fully engorged (puffy, swollen) before penetration, so does female erectile tissue. Without arousal, some forms of touch or penetration can feel unpleasant or painful, a clear message from the body to wait. For example, when swollen, the vestibular bulbs cushion either side of the vaginal entrance, essentially acting like air bags and protecting the body during penetration. Engorgement, not vaginal lubrication, is the indicator that a woman\u2019s body may be aroused and ready for penetration.",
    "DISCOVERING THE P-SPOT": "Warning, this will be much funnier if you are familiar with **Dr Grafenberg's claimed discovery of the G-Spot (the Urethral sponge, aka G-spot, aka female prostate, has always been there and was previously documented over the years) and invention of the IUD. I have also developed a device I am calling the UID, or Urethral Interruption Device, for conception prevention in men. Checking the strings will allow the man to determine that the device stays in place and allow for future removal of the device. As we know that women are only fertile for approximately 24 hours every month, but men are fertile 24 hours a day, every day, it only makes sense to put the contraceptive device in the constantly fertile sex. There may be some side effects, but we believe they will not be a deterrent to most men:\n\u00b7         Pain upon insertion (pain relieving medications are available)\n\u00b7         Perforation of the urethra during insertion (not common)\n\u00b7         Heavy bleeding lasting weeks or months (usually ending within 3-5 months)\n\u00b7         Cramping, Headache, Nausea, Acne\n\u00b7         Breast tenderness, Backache, Abdominal and Pelvic pain\n\u00b7         Painful Sex\n\u00b7         Mood changes\n\u00b7         Weight gain\n\u00b7         Internal Cysts\n\u00b7         Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (thought to be caused by filaments in the \u2018strings\u2019)\n\u00b7         May not be used in anyone with active infection of STD\n\u00b7         High cost that may not be covered by insurance\n\u00b7         The device does not protect against STD\u2019s, so condoms use should be continued\n\n*The satirical writing above is based on actual descriptions of the \u2018G Spot discovery\u2019 and actual IUD (intrauterine device) side effects.",
    "IN SEARCH OF THE VAGINAL ORGASM": "Maybe it goes back to the days of Freud:\n\n\u2018In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasm was purely an adolescent phenomenon, and upon reaching puberty the proper response of mature women was a changeover to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. Still another approach was to consider this a sexual inhibition which might respond to a cognitive therapy where corrective suggestions were offered to women to achieve orgasm with \u201cproper masturbation.\u201d\u2019\n\nIn essence, this would mean that a mature (meaning what\u2026 marriageable? female abandons her own pleasure and switches to a method that often provides the most stimulation, pleasure and orgasm for males\u2026\n\nSorry Freud, I\u2019m not doing it wrong. The clitoris is so much more than the small, visible clitoral head (glans), it actually includes a larger internal wishbone shaped structure\n\nAn inch or two inside the vagina is the G Zone, aka G-Spot, an area along the roof of the vagina whereby the urethral sponge can be stimulated. The vagina is located in the pelvic cavity, posterior to the urinary bladder and anterior to the rectum.\u2019\n\n\u2018The interior of the vagina: Like nearly all other internal body structures, poorly supplied with end organs of touch.",
    "YES, KEEP DOING THAT!": "This may be the most informative piece I ever post\u2026\n \nDuring sex, \u2018Yes, keep doing that!\u2019\n \nDoes NOT mean:\n\u2018Speed up.\u2019\n\u2018Switch to something else.\u2019\n \nDoes mean:\n\u2018Keep doing what you are doing.\u2019\n\u2018Do not stop right now.\u2019\n \nXOXO ~Your Lovers",
    "THE G-SPOT STILL DOESN'T EXIST?": "I know I've said this before, but I'm so confused that anyone is still denying the existence of the 'G Spot'? And has similar function (swells around the urethra during arousal) and develops from the same fetal tissue that becomes the female urethral sponge (g-zone)\u2026 Oh right, the prostates not in the ~*~mythical land of vagina~*~. (Seriously, doctors claimed that women's medical conditions were caused by a uterus 'wandering around inside the body'. Likely the same medical authorities that currently assure us the 'G-Spot' doesn't exist... At least you know you\u2019re in good hands! \u2018\u2026 With the wandering womb, Hippocrates connected epilepsy to hysteria describing a seizure as the result of the uterus nearing the liver (Ng, 1999).",
    "THE MALE G-ZONE & CULTURAL DOUBLE STANDARDS": "As a female with a female experience, I naturally have less experience with the male equivalent, but I'm always curious. It is both acceptable and encouraged for most women to seek and experience G-zone (Urethral Sponge) pleasure\/orgasm (sometimes referred to as 'vaginal orgasm', whether that term is accurate is a separate topic.) However many men do not feel a similar level of acceptance experimenting with stimulating the male Sponge\/G-zone (aka prostate) even though it is a homologous structure (developed from the same tissue that became the female urethral sponge) and may provide pleasurable sensation. This may be due in part to the stigma attached to male anal penetration... I think it's important to examine the ways in which social structure affects the well being of all involved, to avoid creating 'sides' that work against each other instead of collaborating for a solution that benefits everyone.",
    "THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT": "The way premenstrual week allows us increased access to awareness, critical thinking, organization, sensitivity and the ability to bring things to completion\u2026\n\nWell, sometimes it sucks too. Sometimes there\u2019s a new moon and I will start bleeding in 4 days and I wake up convinced that no one cares about me and I suck at everything; life, career, sex, all of it. It seems like everything upsets me, I send angry emails to my insurance company (they kind of deserve it, but it\u2019s not the most productive option) and yell at the nice man on the phone trying to help me add beneficiaries to my IRA (even though I did this when I signed up a couple years ago?) The people I\u2019ve had sex with send a nice text saying they hope I feel better soon. Sometimes I am honest about how I feel and what I do\/don\u2019t need to do and am told what I should \u2018just do anyway\u2019.",
    "MEN'S NIPPLES ARE ILLEGAL": "'Men were forced to wear nipple-covering swimsuits prior to 1936, when it became legal to expose nipples in New York state. In 1935, another group of brave male protesters got themselves arrested in Atlantic City for hitting the beach while baring their torsos. Then in 1936, these men legally gained the right to show their nipples in public, laying the foundation for existing New York state laws that allow women to be topless wherever a man is legally allowed to be, Yahoo rep...orts.' https:\/\/www.thegailygrind.com\/\u2026\/did-you-know-it-was-illega\u2026\/\n\nWomen's breasts are for feeding babies and should be naturally bare out of necessity.

    "TOO ASHAMED TO ADMIT WHAT I'VE DONE...": "(Brene Brown, Daring Greatly: I define shame as the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging \u2013 something we\u2019ve experienced, done, or failed to do makes us unworthy of connection. At this point (likely thanks to Brene Brown audiobooks, which I found through the Artemis School), I understand that perceived isolation, the feeling of being the only one who's done this 'bad' thing is the source of varying degrees of shame. They didn't even think it was a big deal, so I mentally de-escalated the situation from Code Red (I'm-a-terrible-person) to Just-another-day-in-Paradise and went along my merry way :)   \n\nMy (imaginary) friend Brene Brown explains that feelings of shame can quietly marinate over a lifetime. Shame needs three things to grow exponentially in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgment.\u201d\nBy keeping quiet, Brown says your shame will grow exponentially. Here\u2019s the bottom line: \u201cShame cannot survive being spoken,\u201d Brown says.",
    "MAGIC WEEK": "I feel like I hear a lot of women say they don\u2019t like this week. That is what we are doing to almost every female body every month and then calling it PMS or labeling them \u2018bitchy\u2019. I don\u2019t waste any time trying to be \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018productive\u2019. During this phase of increased sensitivity and intuition women can tune in more easily, using the guidance of feelings, the full spectrum of pleasure and pain, to assess and evaluate our course... but not if we are avoiding the pain or the \u2018bad\u2019 feelings. Everything else (digestion, immune system, rest, intuition) will be de-prioritized until the perceived \u2018emergency\u2019 seems to be over.",
    "I SHOULDN'T BE AT THE OFFICE WHEN I START BLEEDING...": "But I also believe that women (and ultimately all people, animals and the world) would benefit from becoming more aware of their bodies and needs and making informed choices about when and where they go... Being expected to be at the office, or wherever, at a time when my body physically needs to recline and rest (my personal experience, your mileage may vary) is detrimental to my health, happiness, negatively impacts those around me and ultimately the world. Bleeding time can be a very powerful time, during which women may find that they have unique awareness, skill and power not available through the rest of the month. But when we don't feel that our lifestyle, job, culture, partner, will allow us the downtime we need to ride the cyclical wave through the month, we have to push, push, push our bodies and spirits beyond their limits. I've experimented  and find that when I am home wrapped in a cozy nest, especially if someone is loving me and I feel safe, relaxed and cared for (I initially thought I would want to spend this time alone, but have found that isn't necessarily true) I don't have any 'bitchiness' problems.",
    "GRATITUDE AND POLARITY": "~The masculine feminine attraction is created by the polarity~\nSo what motivates us to ever seek to destroy those differences? He doesn\u2019t fear my feminine just because it is foreign to him, but actually seeks out and basks in the complementary energy, so different from his own. He doesn\u2019t seek to \u2018help\u2019 me by trying to change me to be like him or criticize me for not feeling like him or doing things his way. The other night, I mentioned a sadness at growing up in a culture that doesn\u2019t accept or appreciate some of the most amazing qualities and skills possessed by women. I feel better - and better about myself- every moment we spend together, because you are all of those things and I feel them when I\u2019m with you.\u2019 What a difference to be a joy, instead of an inconvenience, to the masculine that I have always craved to be wrapped up in."
