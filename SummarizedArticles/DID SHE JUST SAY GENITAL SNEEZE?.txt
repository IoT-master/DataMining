Every time I hear someone refer to an orgasm as a ‘genital sneeze’ it makes me cringe. It is reminiscent of Freud stating that clitoral orgasms were ‘juvenile’ and that mature women should have ‘vaginal’ orgasms instead. (That one never made sense anyway… http://www.apsexed.com/blog/in-search-of-the-vaginal-orgasm ) It implies that one is less than the other, not good or not desirable. The community that the sneeze comment is originating from is the same one that is typically sex positive and advocates against this kind of sexual shaming. And also to accept without judgement that a portion of the population might be perfectly happy with the orgasms they are having and uninterested in a life or practice dedicated to finding something else.
