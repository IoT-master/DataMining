Warning, this will be much funnier if you are familiar with **Dr Grafenberg's claimed discovery of the G-Spot (the Urethral sponge, aka G-spot, aka female prostate, has always been there and was previously documented over the years) and invention of the IUD. I have also developed a device I am calling the UID, or Urethral Interruption Device, for conception prevention in men. Checking the strings will allow the man to determine that the device stays in place and allow for future removal of the device. As we know that women are only fertile for approximately 24 hours every month, but men are fertile 24 hours a day, every day, it only makes sense to put the contraceptive device in the constantly fertile sex. There may be some side effects, but we believe they will not be a deterrent to most men:
·         Pain upon insertion (pain relieving medications are available)
·         Perforation of the urethra during insertion (not common)
·         Heavy bleeding lasting weeks or months (usually ending within 3-5 months)
·         Cramping, Headache, Nausea, Acne
·         Breast tenderness, Backache, Abdominal and Pelvic pain
·         Painful Sex
·         Mood changes
·         Weight gain
·         Internal Cysts
·         Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (thought to be caused by filaments in the ‘strings’)
·         May not be used in anyone with active infection of STD
·         High cost that may not be covered by insurance
·         The device does not protect against STD’s, so condoms use should be continued
