The female body contains even more erectile tissue than the male body. Just as the penis needs to be fully engorged (puffy, swollen) before penetration, so does female erectile tissue. Without arousal, some forms of touch or penetration can feel unpleasant or painful, a clear message from the body to wait. For example, when swollen, the vestibular bulbs cushion either side of the vaginal entrance, essentially acting like air bags and protecting the body during penetration. Engorgement, not vaginal lubrication, is the indicator that a womanâ€™s body may be aroused and ready for penetration.
