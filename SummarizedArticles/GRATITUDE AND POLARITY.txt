~The masculine feminine attraction is created by the polarity~
So what motivates us to ever seek to destroy those differences? He doesn’t fear my feminine just because it is foreign to him, but actually seeks out and basks in the complementary energy, so different from his own. He doesn’t seek to ‘help’ me by trying to change me to be like him or criticize me for not feeling like him or doing things his way. The other night, I mentioned a sadness at growing up in a culture that doesn’t accept or appreciate some of the most amazing qualities and skills possessed by women. I feel better - and better about myself- every moment we spend together, because you are all of those things and I feel them when I’m with you.’ What a difference to be a joy, instead of an inconvenience, to the masculine that I have always craved to be wrapped up in.
