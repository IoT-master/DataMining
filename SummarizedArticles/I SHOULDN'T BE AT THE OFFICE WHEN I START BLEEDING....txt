But I also believe that women (and ultimately all people, animals and the world) would benefit from becoming more aware of their bodies and needs and making informed choices about when and where they go... Being expected to be at the office, or wherever, at a time when my body physically needs to recline and rest (my personal experience, your mileage may vary) is detrimental to my health, happiness, negatively impacts those around me and ultimately the world. Bleeding time can be a very powerful time, during which women may find that they have unique awareness, skill and power not available through the rest of the month. But when we don't feel that our lifestyle, job, culture, partner, will allow us the downtime we need to ride the cyclical wave through the month, we have to push, push, push our bodies and spirits beyond their limits. I've experimented  and find that when I am home wrapped in a cozy nest, especially if someone is loving me and I feel safe, relaxed and cared for (I initially thought I would want to spend this time alone, but have found that isn't necessarily true) I don't have any 'bitchiness' problems.
