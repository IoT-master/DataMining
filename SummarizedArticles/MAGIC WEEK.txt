I feel like I hear a lot of women say they don’t like this week. That is what we are doing to almost every female body every month and then calling it PMS or labeling them ‘bitchy’. I don’t waste any time trying to be ‘happy’ or ‘productive’. During this phase of increased sensitivity and intuition women can tune in more easily, using the guidance of feelings, the full spectrum of pleasure and pain, to assess and evaluate our course... but not if we are avoiding the pain or the ‘bad’ feelings. Everything else (digestion, immune system, rest, intuition) will be de-prioritized until the perceived ‘emergency’ seems to be over.
