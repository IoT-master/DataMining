Many of us skip around all day with a tampon, sea sponge or various other items situated comfortably up in the vaginal canal. The lack of distraction is due to the low sensitivity of the vaginal canal, which is sometimes compared to the digestive tract or the scrotum (aka ball sack, aka testicle doily, there’s really no attractive word for this one yet…)

Placing something in the vaginal entrance, the sphincter that closes and protects the vaginal canal, could be quite uncomfortable. However, having a small object near the top of the canal (the end near the cervix and uterus) would hypothetically be no more uncomfortable than food in the intestine, a sensation we are typically blissfully unaware of. The low sensitivity of the vaginal canal explains why women are not walking around experiencing arousal and ‘vaginal’ orgasms all day with an object inside the vaginal canal (a common question among boys). This example also supports the idea that female orgasms occurring during penetration are actually a result of stimulating nearby erectile tissue, not the elusive (and non-existent) ‘vaginal orgasm’.
