The way premenstrual week allows us increased access to awareness, critical thinking, organization, sensitivity and the ability to bring things to completion…

Well, sometimes it sucks too. Sometimes there’s a new moon and I will start bleeding in 4 days and I wake up convinced that no one cares about me and I suck at everything; life, career, sex, all of it. It seems like everything upsets me, I send angry emails to my insurance company (they kind of deserve it, but it’s not the most productive option) and yell at the nice man on the phone trying to help me add beneficiaries to my IRA (even though I did this when I signed up a couple years ago?) The people I’ve had sex with send a nice text saying they hope I feel better soon. Sometimes I am honest about how I feel and what I do/don’t need to do and am told what I should ‘just do anyway’.
