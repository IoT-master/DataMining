As a female with a female experience, I naturally have less experience with the male equivalent, but I'm always curious. It is both acceptable and encouraged for most women to seek and experience G-zone (Urethral Sponge) pleasure/orgasm (sometimes referred to as 'vaginal orgasm', whether that term is accurate is a separate topic.) However many men do not feel a similar level of acceptance experimenting with stimulating the male Sponge/G-zone (aka prostate) even though it is a homologous structure (developed from the same tissue that became the female urethral sponge) and may provide pleasurable sensation. This may be due in part to the stigma attached to male anal penetration... I think it's important to examine the ways in which social structure affects the well being of all involved, to avoid creating 'sides' that work against each other instead of collaborating for a solution that benefits everyone.
