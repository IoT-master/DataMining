The humans in one group are stronger in communication, have an increased ability to read expressions, tone and body language, a strong biological desire for the wellbeing of everyone. The highly vigilant humans in the first group are always subconsciously scanning for potential dangers to themselves, children and the community as a whole. When a member of Group 1 attempts to take a place of leadership, they will be hard pressed to find support when both groups have been conditioned to believe that any display of emotion or compassion makes them unfit to govern or guide. Both groups would benefit from choosing leadership that displays emotion, compassion and sensitivity, because those are traits of humans who will do whatever it takes to care for everyone involved. This puts the minds of Group 1 at ease, but also keeps Group 2 alive.
