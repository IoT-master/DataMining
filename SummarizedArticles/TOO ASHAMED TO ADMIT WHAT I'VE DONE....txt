(Brene Brown, Daring Greatly: I define shame as the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging – something we’ve experienced, done, or failed to do makes us unworthy of connection. At this point (likely thanks to Brene Brown audiobooks, which I found through the Artemis School), I understand that perceived isolation, the feeling of being the only one who's done this 'bad' thing is the source of varying degrees of shame. They didn't even think it was a big deal, so I mentally de-escalated the situation from Code Red (I'm-a-terrible-person) to Just-another-day-in-Paradise and went along my merry way :)   

My (imaginary) friend Brene Brown explains that feelings of shame can quietly marinate over a lifetime. Shame needs three things to grow exponentially in our lives: secrecy, silence, and judgment.”
By keeping quiet, Brown says your shame will grow exponentially. Here’s the bottom line: “Shame cannot survive being spoken,” Brown says.
